# Company Simulator

The company simulator is a console application that lets you play arround with your own company.  
You can by trucks, hire truck drivers and accept transportation tenders.  
It was implemented with a custom State manager that applies the same patterns like Redux.  
In order to test the business logic, we only have to test the reducer which are the only way to change the application state.
This was super easy and a great experience.  
You can find the tests [here](https://github.com/mathis-m/hs-dotnet-project/tree/main/HsDotNetProject/CompanySimulator.Tests).
